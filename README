Rules:
======
- Try to not uset 'set -e'
- Make rule about one/multi instance more strict
  We need a fresh instance for every build because some of builds could be
  unbootable, but all we need is to build using another kernel image, so we
  could just do some manipulations with underlaying storage in future.
